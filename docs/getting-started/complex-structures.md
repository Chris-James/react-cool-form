With React Cool Form you can use [dot](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors#Dot_notation)-and-[bracket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors#Bracket_notation) notation as the name of a field to create arbitrarily deeply nested fields. It's very similar to Lodash's [\_.set](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#set) method.
