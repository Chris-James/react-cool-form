Building highly performant forms is the duty of React Cool Form. It minimizes the number of re-renders and provides the best user experience by the following features:

- No unnecessary re-rendering by leveraging the power of [uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)
- Only triggers re-rendering when the used state is changed
- Filters the errors of untouched fields for better UX (refer the [theory](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/errors-forms-design-guidelines) at No.7)

Here we will explore the `fromState` and some best practices to access it.
